# Plot3D-Read-Write
The existing repositories about plot3d files are found not that universal and compatible, as a result I work on this project, featuring reading and writing plot3d files, especially mesh and field files.

⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠

This respository is especially designed for mesh and field files written in binary.


The extra repositories that are needed:
   numpy, 
  struct


Forecast:
  
  I may complete the function of Mesh.write(), as a function that can write a mesh file,
  and may transplant the functions of scipy.interpolate into this repository. BTW, I'm intended
  to upload the py files designed for files written in ASCII, too.
